## The Results

After dropping the Pi, the acceleration data and footage from the capsule's camera corrupted. The capsule's code and mechanics worked flawlessly, but due to a crash that rendered the plane completely broken we were unable to have any further attempts. We decided to drop the Pi from a tall bridge to try to mimic the results. 

## Deployment

Our Pi was controlled by this website, the three buttons on the screen allowed us to control every aspect of our drop. Selecting the "Drop and Deploy" button would release the capsule from the plane and deploy its parachute.
