# Plane-Emitted-Data-Obtainer

## The Results

After dropping the Pi, the acceleration data and footage from the capsule's camera corrupted. The capsule's code and mechanics worked flawlessly, but due to a crash that rendered the plane completely broken we were unable to have any further attempts. We decided to drop the Pi from a tall bridge to try to mimic the results.
