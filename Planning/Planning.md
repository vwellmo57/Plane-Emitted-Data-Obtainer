# Planning

## What We Want To Have
  Our main goal going in to this project is to drop something from a remote controlled plane and for that thing to collect data possibly from the flight but definently from the fall. The plane would be small with a wingspan of around a meter and the "thing" will have be be quite small as well, ideally under ~150 mm. 

## Easily Foreseable Issues
  We can already identify lots of problems by involving a plane, mainly weight and aerodynamics. When we drop the "thing" we will loose lot's of the planes mass, this will make the plane fly very different as it will have a much lower mass and will fly quicker. To compensate for this we need a very light "thing" that will not produce much lift while under the plane. 
  The other main issue is how will the "thing" survive? It will be falling from about 10 or more meters and with a 200 gram thing it would hit the ground at about 14 m/s, that is very fast and would almost certaily destroy a pi without adaquate protection. To solve this we will use a parachute that will deploy either after released from the plane or at and operator controlled time. 

## The Plan
The "thing" will be made of 3 main components:
