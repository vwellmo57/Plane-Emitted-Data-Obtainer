# Planning

## What We Want To Have
  Our main goal going in to this project is to drop something from a remote controlled plane and for that thing to collect data possibly from the flight but definently from the fall. The plane would be small with a wingspan of around a meter and the "thing" will have be be quite small as well, ideally under ~150 mm. 

## Easily Foreseable Issues
  We can already identify lots of problems by involving a plane, mainly weight and aerodynamics. When we drop the "thing" we will loose lot's of the planes mass, this will make the plane fly very different as it will have a much lower mass and will fly quicker. To compensate for this we need a very light "thing" that will not produce much lift while under the plane. 
  The other main issue is how will the "thing" survive? It will be falling from about 10 or more meters and with a 200 gram thing it would hit the ground at about 14 m/s, that is very fast and would almost certaily destroy a pi without adaquate protection. To solve this we will use a parachute that will deploy either after released from the plane or at and operator controlled time. 

## The Plan
### The Housing
The housing will hold all of the electronics such as the raspi, a camera, power, servo, accelerometer, and anything else we need. The camera will be positioned so it can take pictures or video of the ground while falling. It, the accelerometer, and the servo will need to be bolted so they can't move, the other components don't need to be bolted. 
### The Cap
The cap will screw onto the housing and serves to keep it safe if parachute deployment fails by isolating them from the outside. It also registers with the last component. 
### The Top
The top will be loosley fit onto the cap but able to fall off. It it held in place by a rubber band and servo arm and when released should fly off and release the chute.
